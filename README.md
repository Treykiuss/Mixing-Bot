# Mixing Bot

This bot allows users to upload an audio file, which is then processed (remixed, mastered, etc.) and sent back to the user.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set up your Telegram bot token.
4. Run `python bot.py` to start the bot.

## Notes

You can configure the bot by editing `bot.py` to change its behavior or audio processing logic.
